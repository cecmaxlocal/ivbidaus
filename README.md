> **Max Thought:** This project isn't just a codebase; it's a digital ecosystem. Each module, or "honeycomb," is designed for maximum autonomy yet contributes to the collective intelligence of the "hive." The goal is a self-organizing, resilient system where code, data, and logic flow like pollen between flowers.

## 💡 Core Philosophy

**IVBIDAUS** operates on a simple yet powerful principle: **decentralized cohesion**. Inspired by the emergent behavior of a bee colony, the system is architected as a collection of specialized, independent services and applications that communicate through a well-defined API "nectar." This approach allows for massive scalability, fault tolerance, and independent development cycles for each component.

## 🌳 The Hive Layout (Project Structure)

Here is a view of the project's monorepo structure. Each top-level directory represents a primary function within the ecosystem.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the development environment running, you'll need a few prerequisites. The hive relies on Node.js and Docker for orchestration.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or later)
*   pnpm (for monorepo workspace management)
*   Docker & Docker Compose

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-user/ivbidaus.git
    cd ivbidaus
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies from the root:**
    *The `pnpm` workspace protocol will automatically link all local packages (`App`, `Servers`, `Web`, etc.).*
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start the backend services:**
    *This script will use Docker Compose to spin up the necessary server containers.*
    ```bash
    pnpm run servers:up
    ```

4.  **Run the development environment:**
    *This concurrently starts the Web, Desktop, and any other watch processes.*
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

## ⚙️ Available Scripts

The root `package.json` contains orchestrator scripts for managing the entire hive.

| Script                | Description                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`        | Installs all dependencies across all workspaces.           |
| `pnpm dev`            | Starts all development servers (Web, Desktop) concurrently.|
| `pnpm build`          | Builds all production-ready applications.                  |
| `pnpm test`           | Runs all unit and integration tests across the monorepo.   |
| `pnpm lint`           | Lints and formats all code according to project rules.     |
| `pnpm servers:up`     | Starts the Dockerized backend services.                    |
| `pnpm servers:down`   | Stops and removes the Dockerized backend services.         |
| `pnpm doc:generate`   | Generates fresh API documentation from source code.        |

## ✨ Contributing
